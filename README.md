# URLServerManager
This software allows you to name, describe and categorize your server. After all previous settings you can assign IP addresses and add either one of the most used protocols or use your own. You can also add additional parameters per address. Once you have your server set up, you can assign a program to a protocol (this program has to support start arguments for an IP address and a port). Then you can easily go through your servers and open connections from your favorite program with only one click.
